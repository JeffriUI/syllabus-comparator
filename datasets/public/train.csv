"The basis for education in the last millennium was “reading, writing, and arithmetic;” now it is reading, writing, and computing. Learning to program is an essential part of the education of every student, not just in the sciences and engineering, but in the arts, social sciences, and humanities, as well. Beyond direct applications, it is the first step in understanding the nature of computer science’s undeniable impact on the modern world.  This course covers the first half of our book Computer Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach (the second half is covered in our Coursera course Computer Science: Algorithms, Theory, and Machines). Our intent is to teach programming to those who need or want to learn it, in a scientific context. We begin by introducing basic programming elements such as variables, conditionals, loops, arrays, and I/O. Next, we turn to functions, introducing key concepts such as recursion, modular programming, and code reuse. Then, we present a modern introduction to object-oriented programming.

We use the Java programming language and teach basic skills for computational problem solving that are applicable in many modern computing environments. Proficiency in Java is a goal, but we focus on fundamental concepts in programming, not Java per se.

All the features of this course are available for free. People who are interested in digging deeper into the content may wish to obtain the textbook Computer Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach  (upon which the course is based) or to visit the website introcs.cs.princeton.edu for a wealth of additional material.

We focus on several medium access control protocols and their performance analysis. In the second part, we discuss how medium access control protocols coordinate the access to the communication channel so that information gets through from a source to a destination in the same broadcast local area network. We further discuss local area network and wireless LAN. In this course, we deal with the general issues regarding packet switching networks. We discuss packet networks from two perspectives. One perspective involves external view of the network, and is concerned with services that the network provides to the transport layer that operates above it at the end systems. The second perspective is concerned with the internal operation of a network, including approaches directing information across the network, addressing and routing procedures, as well as congestion control inside the network. In this course, we give an in-depth study of the TCP/IP protocols. We examine the details of how IP enables communications across a collection of networks.

"The basis for education in the last millennium was “reading, writing, and arithmetic;” now it is reading, writing, and computing. Learning to program is an essential part of the education of every student, not just in the sciences and engineering, but in the arts, social sciences, and humanities, as well. Beyond direct applications, it is the first step in understanding the nature of computer science’s undeniable impact on the modern world.  This course covers the first half of our book Computer Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach (the second half is covered in our Coursera course Computer Science: Algorithms, Theory, and Machines). Our intent is to teach programming to those who need or want to learn it, in a scientific context. We begin by introducing basic programming elements such as variables, conditionals, loops, arrays, and I/O. Next, we turn to functions, introducing key concepts such as recursion, modular programming, and code reuse. Then, we present a modern introduction to object-oriented programming.

We use the Java programming language and teach basic skills for computational problem solving that are applicable in many modern computing environments. Proficiency in Java is a goal, but we focus on fundamental concepts in programming, not Java per se.

All the features of this course are available for free. People who are interested in digging deeper into the content may wish to obtain the textbook Computer Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach  (upon which the course is based) or to visit the website introcs.cs.princeton.edu for a wealth of additional material.

"This course offers an in-depth exploration of how customer networks connect to internet service providers (ISPs) to enable critical applications like intranet VPNs, extranets, and broader internet access. You will gain practical knowledge on designing and implementing network connectivity considering physical connection types, redundancy, IP addressing, and autonomous system (AS) numbering to meet both business and technical needs. The course uniquely covers static routing for single and multiple connections to a single ISP, and advances to multihomed strategies using multiple ISPs for maximum redundancy. You will explore configuring routing protocols—especially BGP—to support backup links, load balancing, and proper interaction between customer and provider networks. Additionally, the course tackles scalability challenges in complex service provider environments, addressing IGP and BGP interactions and IP addressing that ensure network stability and efficiency. With a comprehensive curriculum including videos, readings, and hands-on assignments, this course equips network designers and administrators with the expertise to build robust, scalable, and resilient internet connectivity solutions. Its focus on real-world configurations and multilevel connectivity makes it an essential learning experience for professionals aiming to excel in modern network design and management.",aaaa,0
"In this course, we trace the evolution of networks and identify the key concepts and functions that form the basis for layered architecture. We introduce examples of protocols and services that are familiar to the students, and we explain how these services are supported by networks. Further, we explain fundamental concepts in digital communication, and focus on error control techniques that include parity check, polynomial code, and Internet checksum. Students will be required to have some previous programming experience in C-programming (C++/Java), some fundamental knowledge of computer organization and IT architecture and a background in computer science is a plus.",aaaa,0
"Blockchain is undoubtedly a technology that has been talked about little, we are seeing the first steps of this, so it is necessary to start breaking the stereotype that the block chain is all with respect to cryptodivises, Blockchain is much more than that. Therefore, we will talk about the utility and versatility that the block chain can have from a direct approach as a tool for business and companies. The impulse to business with blockchain technology will allow to open a much broader and simplification, safety and advance in different fields.
The block chain requires a theoretical approach for the understanding of the scope and different prospects that are impact.
Throughout this course we will analyze in detail the wide blockchain panorama with a view to an application approach in business, with topics that will allow the student to be able to enter the theoretical knowledge about the different uses that allow the versatility of this new and disruptive technology.
We will review the conceptualization of the block chain in specific types, to later identify areas of impact in detail in which the technological conjunction becomes a reinforcement with the arrival of Blockchain.","Learning Outcomes:
In this course, students learn topics about computer networks that are discussed comprehensively from layer 1 to layer 7. After attending this course, students are able to configure and implement simple computer networks according to existing protocol standards, are able to apply the concept of VLAN, Inter VLAN Routing , LAN Redundancy, Dynamic Addressing, LAN Security, Wireless LAN and Static Protocol Routing in a simple network
