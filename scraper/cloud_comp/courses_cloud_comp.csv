This course builds on the material covered in the Cloud Computing Concepts, Part 1 course. Welcome to the Cloud Computing Applications course, the first part of a two-course series designed to give you a comprehensive view on the world of Cloud Computing and Big Data! In this first course we cover a multitude of technologies that comprise the modern concept of cloud computing. Cloud computing is an information technology revolution that has just started to impact many enterprise computing systems in major ways, and it will change the face of computing in the years to come.

We start the first week by introducing some major concepts in cloud computing, the economics foundations of it and we introduce the concept of big data. We also cover the concept of software defined architectures, and how virtualization results in cloud infrastructure and how cloud service providers organize their offerings. In week two, we cover virtualization and containers with deeper focus, including lectures on Docker, JVM and Kubernates. We finish up week two by comparing the infrastructure as a service offering by the big three: Amazon, Google and Microsoft. 
Week three moves to higher level of cloud offering, including platform as a service, mobile backend as a service and even serverless architectures. We also talk about some of the cloud middleware technologies that are fundamental to cloud based applications such as RPC and REST, JSON and load balancing. Week three also covers metal as a service (MaaS), where physical machines are provisioned in a cloud environment. 
Week four introduces higher level cloud services with special focus on cloud storage services. We introduce Hive, HDFS and Ceph as pure Big Data Storage and file systems, and move on to cloud object storage systems, virtual hard drives and virtual archival storage options. As discussion on Dropbox cloud solution wraps up week 4 and the course. Welcome to the Cloud Computing Applications course, the second part of a two-course series designed to give you a comprehensive view on the world of Cloud Computing and Big Data! In this second course we continue Cloud Computing Applications by exploring how the Cloud opens up data analytics of huge volumes of data that are static or streamed at high velocity and represent an enormous variety of information. Cloud applications and data analytics represent a disruptive change in the ways that society is informed by, and uses information. We start the first week by introducing some major systems for data analysis including Spark and the major frameworks and distributions of analytics applications including Hortonworks, Cloudera, and MapR. By the middle of week one we introduce the HDFS distributed and robust file system that is used in many applications like Hadoop and finish week one by exploring the powerful MapReduce programming model and how distributed operating systems like YARN and Mesos support a flexible and scalable environment for Big Data analytics. In week two, our course introduces large scale data storage and the difficulties and problems of consensus in enormous stores that use quantities of processors, memories and disks. We discuss eventual consistency, ACID, and BASE and the consensus algorithms used in data centers including Paxos and Zookeeper. Our course presents Distributed Key-Value Stores and in memory databases like Redis used in data centers for performance. Next we present NOSQL Databases. We visit HBase, the scalable, low latency database that supports database operations in applications that use Hadoop. Then again we show how Spark SQL can program SQL queries on huge data. We finish up week two with a presentation on Distributed Publish/Subscribe systems using Kafka, a distributed log messaging system that is finding wide use in connecting Big Data and streaming applications together to form complex systems. Week three moves to fast data real-time streaming and introduces Storm technology that is used widely in industries such as Yahoo. We continue with Spark Streaming, Lambda and Kappa architectures, and a presentation of the Streaming Ecosystem. Week four focuses on Graph Processing, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. We introduce the ideas of graph processing and present Pregel, Giraph, and Spark GraphX. Then we move to machine learning with examples from Mahout and Spark. Kmeans, Naive Bayes, and fpm are given as examples. Spark ML and Mllib continue the theme of programmability and application construction. The last topic we cover in week four introduces Deep Learning technologies including Theano, Tensor Flow, CNTK, MXnet, and Caffe on Spark. In the cloud networking course, we will see what the network needs to do to enable cloud computing. We will explore current practice by talking to leading industry experts, as well as looking into interesting new research that might shape the cloud network’s future. This course will allow us to explore in-depth the challenges for cloud networking—how do we build a network infrastructure that provides the agility to deploy virtual networks on a shared infrastructure, that enables both efficient transfer of big data and low latency communication, and that enables applications to be federated across countries and continents? Examining how these objectives are met will set the stage for the rest of the course.

This course places an emphasis on both operations and design rationale—i.e., how things work and why they were designed this way. We're excited to start the course with you and take a look inside what has become the critical communications infrastructure for many applications today.

After completing this hands-on program, you’ll have the foundational and technical context to understand how to build solutions and solve technical problems and how to choose the right AWS solution. You’ll master both the soft skills to become successful cloud consultants and the technical knowledge to go deep into how software gets built, tested and deployed. You’ll also be able to work on a capstone project centered on the Well Architected Framework that you can later share in interviews to demonstrate your job-readiness to potential employers. You can also gain access to the AWS Educate Job Board, where you can explore, search for, and apply to in-demand jobs and internships with leading organizations. Applied Learning Project Through 18 hands-on labs, you’ll use the AWS Management Console to apply skills learned in the videos and readings. Here are a few examples of the activities you’ll perform in this Professional Certificate: In Introduction to Information Technology and AWS Cloud, you’ll create a static website with S3 in the easiest way. This lab will introduce you to the AWS Management Console, help you understand the AWS Cloud, and practice hosting a static website on AWS. In AWS Cloud Technical Essentials, you’ll use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to manage your AWS services’ access and permissions. You’ll practice the steps to add users to groups, manage passwords, log in as users with various permissions, and view the effects of IAM policies. In Automation in the AWS Cloud, you’ll work with AWS CLI, write a bash script to perform a task/write user data script to download code and run it on EC2 and build a run command to uninstall Apache and install nginx. Automation in the Cloud can simplify processes, enable agility and scalability, and help you deploy faster. But how should you master these topics to enhance your career potential? The course kicks off by introducing automation in the cloud, comparing the differences between on-premises and cloud. We'll answer why automation is so powerful and you'll get hands-on by working with AWS CLI. Week 1 closes with automation with scripting by sharing examples of how automation helps and the benefits of using scripts. A focus on Automation isn't complete with an overview of Infrastructure as Code. You'll get introduced to Provisioning and Configuration Management and solve an automation problem with AWS CloudFormation. The instructors will then share some simple automation examples and how various tools can help you get the job done. In the course's final week, we'll cover the various AWS Services and features used for automation, how to scale resource management, and use the Systems Manager console and AWS Config for compliance.

We'll answer why automation is so powerful and you'll get hands-on by working with AWS CLI. Week 1 closes with automation with scripting by sharing examples of how automation helps and the benefits of using scripts. A focus on Automation isn't complete with an overview of Infrastructure as Code. You'll get introduced to Provisioning and Configuration Management and solve an automation problem with AWS CloudFormation. The instructors will then share some simple automation examples and how various tools can help you get the job done. In the course's final week, we'll cover the various AWS Services and features used for automation, how to scale resource management, and use the Systems Manager console and AWS Config for compliance. This course's focus will be on practical aspects of preparing to work as a support agent in organizations with AWS environments. We will start with some review of previous topics covered in the series, with specific attention paid towards debugging and troubleshooting. We’ll then move into concepts around interacting with customers to obtain information and progress towards a solution. In the next module, you'll have the opportunity to view the architecture from various perspectives, such as builder, supporter, and interviewer. We will then shift into preparing you to apply for Cloud Support Associate positions. This will involve diving into resume and portfolio building, as well as the creation of an online presence. The second module will close out with a look at how you can evaluate opportunities and any gaps you may have in your knowledge. The third module of the course will have a focus on interviewing.

You’ll learn to identify the legal risks involved in cloud computing transactions - and to suggest possible solutions. To understand how cloud computing works, we’ll first describe different kinds of cloud services and explain how they differ from in-house IT in terms of control, access, and cybersecurity. To understand how the law applies to cloud computing transactions, we’ll focus on the contracts between cloud providers and their customers. You’ll learn to identify and interpret key contract terms and to assess whether customers might negotiate better terms with providers. Finally, we’ll explain how English law protects trade secrets and copyright works stored in the cloud.

If you’re a lawyer, this course will be your guide to cloud infrastructure and supply chains. If you have a technical or commercial background, this course will introduce you to key legal issues in contracts and intellectual property. In short, if you’re interested in how the law applies to cloud computing, this course is for you. Vast amounts of personal information are processed in the cloud. But who is legally responsible for such ‘personal data’ in cloud environments? What duties do cloud providers like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google have? And what rights can you, as an individual, exercise under data protection law? If you’d like to find out, then this course is for you! First, we’ll look at how the European Union’s ‘General Data Protection Regulation’ (‘GDPR’) regulates the processing of personal data in cloud services. You’ll learn to identify controllers and processors, describe their roles and responsibilities, and understand how cloud customers and providers can comply in practice.
 
Second, we’ll look at international transfers of personal data. We’ll explain how the GDPR can apply to cloud providers and their customers anywhere in the world, as well as how restrictions on international transfers apply to cloud services.
 
Third, we’ll look at how the Network and Information Security (‘NIS’) Directive regulates the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure. You’ll learn to identify cloud providers’ duties to notify security breaches and to keep their services secure, and how to apply those duties to concrete case studies. 

In short, this course covers how the GDPR and NIS Directive apply to cloud services and what cloud providers and their customers should do to comply. Have you ever wondered how a police officer in Europe can obtain evidence from a cloud provider in the USA? Or whether a major cloud provider might abuse its market power? Or in which countries cloud providers pay taxes? If so, then this course is for you! First, we’ll look at how law enforcement agents can request access to cloud data, including data stored outside their borders. You’ll learn to advise cloud providers on responding to access requests and on dealing with potential conflicts with European Union (‘EU’) data protection law. 

Second, we’ll cover EU competition law, including how to define the relevant market for cloud services and to assess market power. You’ll learn to identify when cloud providers might be found to have entered into anti-competitive agreements, or to have abused a dominant position in a market.

Third, we’ll look at how the income from cloud services is taxed. We’ll cover how such income is classified and which countries have the right to tax cloud providers. You’ll learn how tax principles apply to cloud services today, and how this might change in future.

In short, we’ll cover how the rules of law enforcement access, competition law, and tax law apply to cloud services – and you’ll discover the practical steps that cloud providers can take to comply with their obligations.","This Specialization is intended for anyone interested in understanding the legal rights and obligations of providers and customers of cloud services.
