-write foundational SQL statements like: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE 
-filter result sets, use WHERE, COUNT, DISTINCT, and LIMIT clauses 
-differentiate between DML & DDL 
-CREATE, ALTER, DROP and load tables 
-use string patterns and ranges; ORDER and GROUP result sets, and built-in database functions
-build sub-queries and query data from multiple tables 
-access databases as a data scientist using Jupyter notebooks with SQL and Python
-work with advanced concepts like Stored Procedures, Views, ACID Transactions, Inner & Outer JOINs through hands-on labs and projects

You will  practice building SQL queries, work with real databases on the Cloud, and use real data science tools. 

In the final project you’ll analyze multiple real-world datasets to demonstrate your skills.","Working knowledge of SQL (or Structured Query Language) is a must for data professionals like Data Scientists, Data Analysts and Data Engineers.

This course will help you develop your analytical and visualization skills so that you not only improve your current work performance but also expand your future job prospects. For those in business and data analysis who want to master advanced Excel and beginner Power BI, that will add an asset to your employability portfolio. Upon completing this specialization, you will be able to bring data to life using advanced Excel functions, creative visualizations, and powerful automation features. These courses will equip you with a comprehensive set of tools for transforming, linking, and analysing data. You will master a broad range of charts and create stunning interactive dashboards. Finally, you will explore a new dimension in Excel with PowerPivot, Get and Transform, and DAX.  Harnessing the power of an underlying database engine, we will remove the 1,048,576 row limitation, completely automate data transformation, create data models to effectively link data, and open the gateway to Power Business Intelligence. Applied Learning Project Working with datasets similar to those typically found in a business, you will use powerful Excel tools to wrangle the data into shape, create useful visualizations, and prepare dashboards and report to share your results. You will learn to create a data workflow to automate your analysis and make the results flexible and reproducible. In an age now driven by ""big data"", we need to cut through the noise and present key information in a way that can be quickly consumed and acted upon making data visualization an increasingly important skill. Visualizations need to not only present data in an easy to understand and attractive way, but they must also provide context for the data, tell a story, achieving that fine balance between form and function. Excel has many rivals in this space, but it is still an excellent choice, particularly if it's where your data resides. It offers a wealth of tools for creating visualizations other than charts and the chart options available are constantly increasing and improving, so the newer versions now include waterfall charts, sunburst diagrams and even map charts. But what sets Excel apart is its flexibility, it gives us total creative control over our designs so if needed we could produce our own animated custom chart to tell the right story for our data. Over five weeks we will explore Excel's rich selection of visualization tools using practical case studies as seen through the eyes of Rohan, an environmental analyst. Rohan is required to produce visualizations that will show trends, forecasts, breakdowns and comparisons for a large variety of environmental data sets. As well as utilising the usual chart types he wants to use conditional formats, sparklines, specialised charts and even create his own animated charts and infographics. In some cases, he will also need to prepare the data using pivot tables to drill down and answer very specific questions. We are going to help him achieve all this and present our finished visualizations in attractive reports and dashboards that use tools like slicers and macros for automation and interactivity.

These are the topics we will cover:
Week 1: 	Dynamic visualizations with conditional formatting, custom number formatting, sparklines and macros
Week 2: 	Charting techniques for telling the right story
Week 3: 	Creating specialised and custom charts
Week 4: 	Summarising and filtering data with pivot tables and pivot charts

In this course we focus on Data Visualization in Excel, join us for this exciting journey. Welcome to Excel Power Tools for Data Analysis. In this four-week course, we introduce Power Query, Power Pivot and Power BI, three power tools for transforming, analysing and presenting data. Excel's ease and flexibility have long made it a tool of choice for doing data analysis, but it does have some inherent limitations: for one, truly ""big"" data simply does not fit in a spreadsheet and for another, the process of importing and cleaning data can be a repetitive, time-consuming and error-prone. Over the last few years, Microsoft have worked on transforming the end-to-end experience for analysts, and Excel has undergone a major upgrade with the inclusion of Power Query and Power Pivot.

In this course, we will learn how to use Power Query to automate the process of importing and preparing data for analysis. We will see how Power Pivot revolutionises the actual analysis process by providing us with an analytical database inside the Excel workbook, capable of storing millions of rows, and a powerful modelling language called DAX which allows us to perform advanced analytics on our data. We will finish off by venturing out of Excel and introducing Power BI, which also uses the Power Query and Power BI architecture but allows us to create stunning interactive reports and dashboards.
