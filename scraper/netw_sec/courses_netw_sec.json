Students will require a prior knowledge of C programming, an understanding of math probability and a computer science background is a plus. Applied Learning Project The assessments covers fundamental computer networking concepts and principles which will guide the learner to apply the networking theory and design principles, verify their understandings, and build a solid foundation for creating innovations in today's Internet. It lays foundations of network architectures, protocol design principles, and TCP/IP programming skills, which are necessary to take more advanced courses in graduate study and/or technical training in the industry. It covers basic networking knowledge and in-depth understanding of the inner-workings of computer networks and their evolution. Communication systems, from simple to asynchronous point-to-point links, to those based on complex network architectures will be assessed. In this course, we trace the evolution of networks and identify the key concepts and functions that form the basis for layered architecture. We introduce examples of protocols and services that are familiar to the students, and we explain how these services are supported by networks. Further, we explain fundamental concepts in digital communication, and focus on error control techniques that include parity check, polynomial code, and Internet checksum. Students will be required to have some previous programming experience in C-programming (C++/Java), some fundamental knowledge of computer organization and IT architecture and a background in computer science is a plus. In this course, we discuss peer-to-peer protocols and local area networks. Part one in this course is to answer the question of how does a peer-to-peer protocol deliver reliable data transfer service across unreliable transmission lines or networks.  We focus on several medium access control protocols and their performance analysis. In the second part, we discuss how medium access control protocols coordinate the access to the communication channel so that information gets through from a source to a destination in the same broadcast local area network. We further discuss local area network and wireless LAN. In this course, we deal with the general issues regarding packet switching networks. We discuss packet networks from two perspectives. One perspective involves external view of the network, and is concerned with services that the network provides to the transport layer that operates above it at the end systems. The second perspective is concerned with the internal operation of a network, including approaches directing information across the network, addressing and routing procedures, as well as congestion control inside the network. In this course, we give an in-depth study of the TCP/IP protocols. We examine the details of how IP enables communications across a collection of networks. We pay particular attention to the hierarchical structure of IP addresses and explain their role in ensuring scalability of the Internet. The role of address prefixes and the uses of masks are explained in details. We review in details about TCP three-way handshake, flow control, and congestion control. Furthermore, we provide an introduction to some advanced topics, including Multicast, SDN and security",

The learning outcome is simple: We hope learners will develop a lifelong passion and appreciation for cyber security, which we are certain will help in future endeavors. Students, developers, managers, engineers, and even private citizens will benefit from this learning experience. Special customized interviews with industry partners were included to help connect the cyber security concepts to live business experiences. Applied Learning Project Quizzes and projects for Introduction to Cyber Security were designed to exercise the learner’s understanding and retention of the covered topics. Emphasis is on foundational issues, rather than just memorizing facts. The goal is to help learners develop the habit of properly assessing and improving cyber risk posture in real computing, networking, and software systems. Authentic scenarios are included based on practical enterprise and infrastructure deployments to enhance the learning experience. This course provides learners with a baseline understanding of common cyber security threats, vulnerabilities, and risks. An overview of how basic cyber attacks are constructed and applied to real systems is also included. Examples include simple Unix kernel hacks, Internet worms, and Trojan horses in software utilities. Network attacks such as distributed denial of service (DDOS) and botnet- attacks are also described and illustrated using real examples from the past couple of decades. Familiar analytic models are outlined such as the confidentiality/integrity/availability (CIA) security threat framework, and examples are used to illustrate how these different types of threats can degrade real assets. The course also includes an introduction to basic cyber security risk analysis, with an overview of how threat-asset matrices can be used to prioritize risk decisions. Threats, vulnerabilities, and attacks are examined and mapped in the context of system security engineering methodologies. This course introduces the basics of cyber defense starting with foundational models such as Bell-LaPadula and information flow frameworks. These underlying policy enforcements mechanisms help introduce basic functional protections, starting with authentication methods. Learners will be introduced to a series of different authentication solutions and protocols, including RSA SecureID and Kerberos, in the context of a canonical schema. The basics of cryptography are also introduced with attention to conventional block ciphers as well as public key cryptography. Important cryptographic techniques such as cipher block chaining and triple-DES are explained. Modern certification authority-based cryptographic support is also discussed and shown to provide basis for secure e-commerce using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) schemes. This course introduces real-time cyber security techniques and methods in the context of the TCP/IP protocol suites. Explanation of some basic TCP/IP security hacks is used to introduce the need for network security solutions such as stateless and stateful firewalls. Learners will be introduced to the techniques used to design and configure firewall solutions such as packet filters and proxies to protect enterprise assets. Perimeter solutions such as firewalls and intrusion prevention systems are shown to have significant drawbacks in common enterprise environments. The result of such weakness is shown to often exist as advanced persistent threats (APTs) from nation-state actors. Such attacks, as well as DDOS and third-party attacks, are shown to have potential solutions for modern enterprise. This course introduces a series of advanced and current topics in cyber security, many of which are especially relevant in modern enterprise and infrastructure settings. The basics of enterprise compliance frameworks are provided with introduction to NIST and PCI. Hybrid cloud architectures are shown to provide an opportunity to fix many of the security weaknesses in modern perimeter local area networks. Emerging security issues in blockchain, blinding algorithms, Internet of Things (IoT), and critical infrastructure protection are also described for learners in the context of cyber risk. Mobile security and cloud security hyper-resilience approaches are also introduced. The course completes with some practical advice for learners on how to plan careers in cyber security.",

Finally, you will be presented with some of the key components of practical cyber security management and its governance. This includes what happens when things go wrong, understanding how organisations can respond to incidents, through to the essential role of people in achieving better cyber security outcomes. The purpose of this short four-week course is to introduce the topic of computer system security. We initially look at a short basic introduction to computer system core components and functions and then extend this to consider a variety of topics from hardware to applications. Throughout we provide pointers to openly available materials for background and further reading to explore the topics. We refer to the Cyber Security Body of Knowledge (CyBOK) as a reference for cyber security knowledge, alongside other sources that are widely available. In total, we have four weeks that cover this introduction to computer systems and security. No prior programming nor advanced mathematical knowledge Is required. There are a few examples of pseudocode and some basic computer logic (AND, OR, XOR, etc.) in our Week 1 Introduction to computer systems, but these are not essential to completing the course. In other lessons, we introduce basic concepts and provide pointers to online resources. \n \nThe course includes active learning through four lab sessions. The first lab introduces the Linux operating system in general by exploring the Linux desktop and applications provided in the Coursera lab environment hosted in the AWS cloud. The second lab looks at the Linux command line and explores some of the file system and gathers system information, for example to explore processes. The third lab explores the network information, the system connectivity, and uses some Python scripts and Wireshark to examine the TCP and UDP transport protocols and the web/HTTP application protocol.  Lastly we explore more about the network services using the Nmap tool to explore the network services in the system.   \n \nThe course is designed to provide a wide introduction to computer security, by outlining computer systems, including the operating system, programs, data and networking. We discuss some of the issues in computer security and introduce some of the vulnerabilities and threats as we progress through the four weeks. We include some optional readings and videos from a number of sources, including professional resources and vendor materials for additional study. The security of computer networks is a key element in cyber security. Computer networking provides the foundational connectivity services that are used for the world wide web, distributed computer applications and services, operations and manufacturing, and national infrastructure. This course provides understanding of key technologies used in computer networks and infrastructure. This includes protocols, computer networks, data centres, operational technologies that form key infrastructure critical to the success of organisations and services from a local to an international scale.  The course discusses vulnerabilities and the exploits that target computer networks, systems, and the Internet infrastructure.  \n\nBy the end of this course learners will be able to:\n\n1.\tShow a systematic understanding of digital networks and their operation, including the OSI 7 layer architecture and the TCP/IP protocol stack. \n2.\tDiscuss key security threats and risks faced in computer networks. \n3.\tDemonstrate a critical understanding of network security architecture and design rationale of selected protocols, security technologies and how they are used in practice. \n4.\tIdentify attack models and analyse vulnerabilities in protocols, network systems, and applications.  \n5.\tDemonstrate how these vulnerabilities may be exploited in practice to penetrate a system. In this course you will look at some of the key components of practical cyber security management and its governance. This includes what happens when things go wrong, understanding how organisations can respond to incidents, through to the essential role of people in achieving better cyber security outcomes. Together, you will examine how incident management, cyber resilience, and developing an effective appreciation of people, not simply as users but as active participants, can enable better cyber security outcomes. The topics covered include: \n•\tIdentifying what an incident is\n•\tIncident preparation, planning, and response\n•\tCyber resilience\n•\tThe role of people in security management\n•\tThe building of trust and developing positive cyber security cultures\n\nBy completing this course, you will learn how to integrate incident management and a rich knowledge of people into a real-world Information Security Management System for an organisation. This course introduces fundamental notions of cybercrime. Namely,  what cybercrime is,  the main questions surrounding cybercrime,  how cybercrime can be defined, and how it can be studied. You will learn about the difficulties in measuring the occurrence, the frequency and the impact of cybercrime, and build a scepticism on the reliability and the interpretation of cybercrime reports.  \nYou will be introduced to discussion about human aspects of cybercrime,  in particular, the actors related to cybercrime, that is, the criminals, the victims, and law enforcement.  \n\nYou will also learn about aspects such as personality, national and organisational culture, security culture, training, and other components which affect cybercriminal activity. Finally, you will dive into what is arguably the most important attack vector in cybercrime, that is, social engineering.  You will gain an understanding of how it occurs, which techniques social engineers utilise, and which are the underlying psychological principles which make all of us – as humans – susceptible to social engineering attacks.\n\nBy the end of the course you should be able to:\n\n•\tReflect on the main questions related to cybercrime.\n•\tExplain the meaning, definitions, importance, and impact of cybercrime. \n•\tAssess the reliability and the interpretation of reports and surveys related to cybercrime.\n•\tIdentify the various classifications of cybercrime, the related threats, and threat actors.\n•\tExplain the key role of human aspects in cybercrime.\n•\tDifferentiate between the various actors involved in cybercrime and their associated perspectives.\n•\tEvaluate the underlying psychological principles which make social engineering the most successful attack vector in cybercrime.\n•\tDescribe how deception and social engineering manifest and how they can be defended against.",
